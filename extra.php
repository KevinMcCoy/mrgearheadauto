<ul>

<li>Preventative fluid maintenance services</li>
</ul>
<p>We offer these fluid maintenance services in combination packages, alone, or added to scheduled maintenance services. We offer the following services to help you and your vehicle stay ahead of the game. See below for suggested maintenance schedule for the health and happiness of your car!</p>
<h3>Automatic Transmission Flush Service</h3>
<p>The fluid inside your transmission is designed not only to regulate the operating temperature of your transmission but also the fluid is actually what makes the transmission shift gears. Over time the transmission fluid breaks down and begins to aerate and is no longer able to perform itâ€™s multiple functions optimally.</p>
<h4>Recommended maintenance schedule: Every 10,000 miles or once a year.</h4>
<p><BR></p>
<h3>Coolant Flush Service</h3>
<p>Coolant is a heat transfer fluid which flows through your engine to prevent it from overheating, transferring the heat produced by the engine to the radiator in order to dissipate it. Coolant is the second most important fluid for the long term health of your engine after the engine oil. The lack of changing your coolant can lead to overheating the engine, the breakdown of the cooling system components and can result in catastrophic damage such as blown head gaskets.</p>
<h4>Recommended maintenance schedule: Every 20,000 miles or every other year.</h4>
<p><BR></p>
<h3>Fuel &amp; Intake System Flush</h3>
<p>Fuel injectors provide the push of the gasoline into the engine&#8217;s combustion area by way of spraying it inside. A fuel injector flush is a means of cleaning the injectors themselves for proper operation. Maintaining proper fuel injector performance helps save gas by having efficient fuel spraying within the engine. Additionally, keeping the injectors clean helps keep the entire engine clean by verifying that foreign matter is not floating about the compartment. Any foreign matter inside the engine can damage it substantially.</p>
<h4>Recommended maintenance schedule: Every 10,000 miles or once a year.</h4>
<p><BR></p>
<h3>Power Steering Flush</h3>
<p>Power steering fluid is probably the most neglected of any automotive fluid. Your power steering system pressures can reach upwards of 2500psi and the heat generated brakes down fluid, causing it to lose its lubricating ability. Power steering fluid flushing also removes any particles (metal, plastic, etc) which are known to cause failures within the power steering system.</p>
<h4>Recommended maintenance schedule: Every time you have a transmission flush performed.</h4>
<p><BR></p>
<h3>Brake Fluid Flush</h3>
<p>Brake fluid is used to transfer force under pressure from the master cylinder reservoir through hydraulic lines to the braking calipers or wheel cylinders near the wheels. Braking applications produce a lot of heat so brake fluid must have a high boiling point to remain effective and must also not freeze under normal temperatures. As part of its chemical makeup, brake fluid is hygroscopic which means it attracts water. Since water is not compressible its causes brake fluid to function less efficiently. In order to keep your brake system performing at its best, we recommend that you replace the fluid often.</p>
